EyeSpy is an application designed to reduce eye strain while looking at a computer screen. It utilizes computer vision to count the number of times the user blinks during their work session and determines whether they are blinking a healthy ammount. In addition, the application queues eye exercises once a user is on their break to relieve eye strain.
